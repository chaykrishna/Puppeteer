# Puppeteer Project

This project demonstrates how to use **Puppeteer**, a Node.js library, to automate browsing tasks like interacting with web pages, scraping content, or accessing a website when it's temporarily down due to heavy traffic. This can be particularly useful when accessing high-traffic websites such as result portals, where the server might crash due to too many simultaneous users.

## Features

- Automate the process of visiting a website.
- Retry access in case the website is temporarily down.
- Monitor server responses for website availability.
- Provides a simple script to interact with websites using Puppeteer.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

If you haven't installed Node.js and npm yet, follow the installation instructions on the official website.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chaykrishna/Puppeteer.git
    cd Puppeteer
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies, including Puppeteer:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install Puppeteer and any other dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Run the project**:

    After installation, you can run the script to automate website interaction. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    node puppeteer-script.js
    ```

    This will start Puppeteer and execute the script (for example, visiting a website or checking its availability).

## Usage

Once the script is running, it will attempt to access the specified website. If the website is temporarily unavailable, the script will retry periodically until it is back online. You can customize the retry logic and website URL in the `puppeteer-script.js` file.

### Example Command

```bash
node puppeteer-script.js
